                            Hey üëã! I‚Äôm Andrei Vivar, a 5th-year Software Engineering student at Thompson Rivers University, and your friendly
                            neighborhood aspiring Data Engineer and AI/ML enthusiast. Thanks to my program at TRU, I‚Äôve built a rock-solid
                            foundation in software engineering &#40;including debugging at 3 a.m.‚Äîa true rite of passage&#41;. These skills have
                            equipped me not just to survive the tech world, but to thrive and innovate within it.
                        </div>

                        <div class="second-parag">
                            My journey into tech has been quite the plot twist! üöÄ My first two co-op terms as an <strong>Engineering Project Assistant</strong> at Houle introduced me to real-world problem-solving, while my
                            third term as a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> at TRU sparked my love affair with data &#40;fun fact: I started out wanting to be a game designer...oh, how the tables turned&#41;. By my fourth term, I was
                            leading the charge at <strong>Kamloops Film Society</strong>, designing a database for their MovieMart collection.
                            And now? I‚Äôm juggling roles as an <strong>AI/ML Engineer Intern</strong> for not one, not two, but <strong>three companies</strong>‚ÄîAIModels, ChmlTech, and Ecobased.AI‚Äîthrough Riipen. It‚Äôs like a tech sitcom,
                            and I‚Äôm the overbooked protagonist.

                            Outside of work, I‚Äôm living proof that tech nerds can have fun too. Back in 2020, I founded the <strong>TRUSU Anime Club</strong>, and guess what? It‚Äôs now thriving with over <strong>500 members</strong>.
                            &#40;Yes, I‚Äôm basically the Luffy of this pirate crew.&#41; Speaking of pirates, <strong>One Piece</strong> is my all-time
                            favorite anime. As for games, I‚Äôve been playing them since I could hold a controller, and my all-time favorite
                            is <strong>Persona 5 Royal</strong>. I even try to gamify my life‚Äîbecause if you‚Äôre not earning XP, are you even
                            living?

Andrei completed these projects on schedule and went over and above his job description helping our team with various tech challenges. He is an excellent communicator and problem-solver and was a pleasure to work with. I would highly recommend Andrei to future employers and look forward to seeing where his skills and can-do attitude take him!',
    //     'Alma Klarich': 'I hired Andrei as a student co-op in early 2024 to support our department with our data analytic capabilities. In the four-month term, I found Andrei to be very reliable and professional. He was willing to learn new things that were not always directly related to his studies, and in a profession that was unfamiliar to him (internal auditing). He has a very pleasant personality and attitude, combined with a sought-after technical skill set. I would not hesitate to recommend him to future employers. All the best to you, Andrei, as you take on new pursuits!'

                            Hey ðŸ‘‹! Iâ€™m Andrei Vivar, a 5th-year Software Engineering student at Thompson Rivers University, and your friendly
                            neighborhood aspiring Software Engineer and AI/ML enthusiast. Thanks to my program at TRU, Iâ€™ve built a rock-solid
                            foundation in software engineering &#40;including debugging at 3 a.m.â€”a true rite of passage&#41;. These skills have
                            equipped me not just to survive the tech world, but to thrive and innovate within it.

                            My journey into tech has been quite the plot twist! ðŸš€ My first two co-op terms as an <strong>Engineering Project Assistant</strong> at Houle introduced me to real-world problem-solving, while my
                            third term as a <strong>Data Analyst</strong> at TRU sparked my love affair with data &#40;fun fact: I started out wanting to be a game designer...oh, how the tables turned&#41;. By my fourth term, I was
                            leading the charge at <strong>Kamloops Film Society</strong>, designing a database for their MovieMart collection.
                            And now? Iâ€™m juggling roles as an <strong>AI/ML Engineer Intern</strong> for not one, not two, but <strong>three companies</strong>â€”AIModels, ChmlTech, and Ecobased.AIâ€”through Riipen. Itâ€™s like a tech sitcom,
                            and Iâ€™m the overbooked protagonist.

                            Outside of work, Iâ€™m a living proof that tech nerds can have fun too. Back in 2020, I founded the <strong>TRUSU Anime Club</strong>, and guess what? Itâ€™s now thriving with over <strong>500 members</strong>.
                            &#40;Yes, Iâ€™m basically the Luffy of this pirate crew.&#41; Speaking of pirates, <strong>One Piece</strong> is my all-time
                            favorite anime. As for games, Iâ€™ve been playing them since I could hold a controller, and my all-time favorite
                            is <strong>Persona 5 Royal</strong>. I even try to gamify my lifeâ€”because if youâ€™re not earning XP, are you even
                            living?
